# tlapser360
Used to shoot time lapse 360 photos with cameras that support the Open Spherical Camera API.

I use this script on a raspberry pi with a Ricoh Theta S camera. It supports geotaging
with gpsd and camera metering via an adafruit LUX meter.

Early test fotage can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IugTnvYjy6A

Use at your own risk.
